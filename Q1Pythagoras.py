# Create a program that will accept the two legs of a right-angle triangle, a and b, and display the length of the hypotenuse, c. 
# Remember to use prompts for the input and labels for the output. Use the formula a2 + b2 = c2 to calculate your answer.
a = float(input("Enter value for leg a of triangle"))**2
b = float(input("Enter value for leg b of triangle"))**2
c = float(input(a + b))
print("Here is your hypoteneuse!")
